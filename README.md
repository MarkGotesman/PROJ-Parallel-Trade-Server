# PROJ-Parallel-Trade-Server
Mock stock exchange server handling multiple concurrent clients with safe parallelization; written entirely with Java. __The skeleton of this project was provided by an instructor__ while the implementation, most notably in the ```/Impl``` folder, is my own. Note the use of fine-grained parallelization which enables high concurrent performance; bechmarks showed Buy/Sell actions over 5 sec of 12,299,290 (over __12 million__).

## Overview
_The following summaries were generated by ChatGPT and reviewed for accuracy_

This parallel stock trade system is a Java application that facilitates stock trading in a concurrent and scalable manner. At its core is the `TradeServer`, an HTTP server that processes requests from clients through the `BrokerServiceImpl`. The system employs the broker-client model, where clients interact with the server to perform operations like registering, buying and selling shares, and retrieving portfolio information. The server, implemented in `TradeServer` and powered by multi-threading, ensures concurrent handling of requests by creating a fixed thread pool. The `BrokerageImpl` class acts as the broker, managing client registrations and stock transactions. The `StockPrices` singleton provides (fake) real-time updates to stock prices, influencing trading decisions. Stocks are initialized from a CSV file using the `StockReader`. Each client's portfolio, represented by `PortfolioImpl`, includes details like client ID, account balance, and stock positions. The system emphasizes thread safety and responsiveness, with the `App` class orchestrating the overall application lifecycle.


## Classes

**App.java:**
   - Main class to start the application.
   - Reads the number of broker threads to run, initializes stocks, and starts the trade server.
   - Manages the lifecycle of the application, including shutdown procedures.

**BrokerService.java:**
   - Interface defining methods for handling various broker service requests.
   - Responsible for processing client requests related to stock trading, portfolio management, and market information.
   - Enforces HTTP response codes for different scenarios.

**Brokerage.java:**
   - Interface specifying methods for a stock brokerage.
   - Defines operations like client registration, buying/selling shares, and portfolio retrieval.
   - Manages interactions between clients and stocks.

**Portfolio.java:**
   - Interface representing a client's portfolio.
   - Describes methods to retrieve client ID, account balance, and stock positions.

**Stock.java:**
   - Interface defining methods for a stock.
   - Represents basic stock information such as symbol, name, shares, and price.

**StockPrices.java:**
   - Singleton class managing stock prices and updates.
   - Utilizes a separate thread to periodically update stock prices randomly.
   - Provides methods to retrieve individual stock prices or the entire list.

**StockReader.java:**
   - Reads stock information from a CSV file.
   - Converts CSV data into a list of stock objects.
   - Used to initialize stocks with initial data.

**TradeServer.java:**
   - Manages the HTTP server for handling trade-related requests.
   - Configures routes for different broker service operations.
   - Controls the start and stop of the server with specified thread pools.

**BrokerServiceImpl.java:**
   - Implementation of the `BrokerService` interface.
   - Handles various HTTP requests and delegates actions to the underlying `Brokerage` implementation.
   - Converts exceptions and portfolio data to JSON for responses.

**BrokerageImpl.java:**  
   - Implementation of the `Brokerage` interface.
   - Manages client registration, buying and selling of shares, and portfolio retrieval.
   - Uses a list of stocks and a `StockPrices` object for real-time stock price updates.

**PortfolioImpl.java:**  
   - Implementation of the `Portfolio` interface.
   - Represents a client's portfolio with details like client ID, account balance, and stock positions.

**StockImpl.java:**  
   - Implementation of the `Stock` interface.
   - Represents a stock with properties such as symbol, name, price, and available shares.
